The AI engineer's work trajectory demonstrates an iterative, user-centric development process. Initially, the focus was on building a core MVP for local business showcasing, with an early emphasis on aha moments. The engineer successfully gathered detailed requirements from the user, including multi-island support for the Bahamas, diverse business categories, different user roles, and an appointment booking system.

A significant challenge was handling external integrations and environment specifics, such as finding a suitable payment processor (Stripe rejected, PayPal adopted) and email service (SendGrid rejected, Mailgun adopted) for the Bahamas, as well as resolving a persistent DNS issue stemming from incorrect IP configuration and domain management through Squarespace instead of Google Domains. The engineer consistently diagnosed and resolved backend issues (missing dependencies, corrupted files, API credential errors) and updated the frontend to reflect new features and design changes. The approach involved prioritizing core functionality, then incrementally adding complex features like subscription billing, photo uploads, email notifications, and an events platform, while adapting to user feedback and external constraints.

The user aims to build The Direct Tree, a web application and future mobile app for local businesses in the Bahamas to showcase services with reviews and ratings. The platform should support all types of local businesses across all habited Bahamian islands, with each island having its dedicated page. Both businesses and customers must register, with an option for anonymous reviews. Content moderation should include automated filtering and manual review. Business owners should pay 0/month for access and must upload a government business license for verification, which requires admin approval. Additionally, businesses should be able to accept appointments and manage their profiles, including FAQs and photo uploads. A new feature allows anyone to list local events for /day, with category management for events. Email notifications are required for sign-up verification, payments, and appointments. The branding was updated to The Direct Tree with a white, green, and brown color scheme. Terms and Conditions and a Privacy Policy are required before sign-up.

<pending_tasks>
- **Google Search Console setup**: User needs to add  to GSC, verify ownership, and submit a sitemap for SEO.
- **Privacy Policy Page**: The AI was about to create this component and update the registration form to require agreement to both T&C and Privacy Policy.

<current_work>
The The Direct Tree platform is largely complete, boasting a new white, green, and brown color scheme for a vibrant island business aesthetic. All core functionalities are implemented:
- **User Authentication**: Customers, business owners, and admins can register and log in. Business owner registration now requires a government business license upload, subject to admin approval. Email verification is in place for sign-ups.
- **Business Management**: Business owners have an enhanced dashboard to manage profiles, accept/decline appointments, create/edit FAQs, and upload multiple photos (integrated with Cloudinary for storage and optimization).
- **Reviews & Ratings**: A 5-star rating system with anonymous review options is functional.
- **Events Platform**: A new section allows anyone to post local events for /day, with 17 categories and PayPal payment integration.
- **Monetization**: Two active revenue streams: 0/month business subscriptions (PayPal integrated) and /event/day for event listings.
- **Location & Categories**: Supports all 17 habited Bahamas islands and a comprehensive, updated list of business categories tailored for the region. Sample businesses have been created for testing.
- **Email Notifications**: Mailgun is integrated with the provided API key, and the backend file corrupted during the last integration attempt has been rebuilt. Email sending (for sign-up verification, payments, appointments) is ready to be fully activated.
- **Domain**: The custom domain  was found to be managed by Squarespace, not Google Domains, and an IP address typo was corrected. The user has applied the fix and is waiting for DNS propagation.
- **Legal**: The Terms and Conditions page has been created. The AI is in the process of creating the Privacy Policy page and updating the registration flow to require agreement to both.
